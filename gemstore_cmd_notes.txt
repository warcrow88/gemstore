C:\Users\kelle\Documents\Coding Temple Course 2018\week_7_folder>create-react-app gemstore

Creating a new React app in C:\Users\kelle\Documents\Coding Temple Course 2018\week_7_folder\gemstore.

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...

+ react-dom@16.5.2
+ react@16.5.2
+ react-scripts@2.0.3
added 1728 packages from 664 contributors and audited 31900 packages in 76.33s
found 0 vulnerabilities


Initialized a git repository.

Success! Created gemstore at C:\Users\kelle\Documents\Coding Temple Course 2018\week_7_folder\gemstore
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd gemstore
  npm start

Happy hacking!
